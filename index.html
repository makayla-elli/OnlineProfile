            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my digital portfolio! My name is MaKayla Elliott, and I am currently a dedicated
                college student pursuing a degree in Business and Management at OTC. However, this semester I’ve also
                been exploring web development. Throughout the semester, I have been on an exciting journey exploring
                HTML and CSS in my web design class.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is a testament to my learning experience, showcasing my ability to blend creativity with
                technical proficiency. I invite you to explore the different pages and witness how I have implemented
                various HTML and CSS techniques to create an engaging user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my coursework, I’m passionate about finding new ways to apply my knowledge and continue improving
                my coding skills. I believe that the world of web design offers limitless possibilities, and I am eager
                to contribute to it by crafting innovative digital experiences for users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and share in my learning journey. I hope you find it
                informative and inspiring as I continue to hone my skills in web design and development. Feel free to

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
            <p>
                My passion for design extends beyond web development as I often find myself experimenting with graphic
                design tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Canva. I have dabbled in social media graphics for the
                small business I used to work for and for my local Walmart, I now work for. I believe this work
                complements my web design skills and helps me develop a keen eye for aesthetics.
            </p>
            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>
                As a total bookworm, I spend a lot of my spare time reading. One of my favorite ways to relax and get
                off my phone is by reading a book. I have a Kindle also but I prefer to read a real book and feel the
                pages in my hand. Reading was always something I loved my entire life during school but I stopped during
                high school when I got busy with all my different priorities. I recently picked it back up and am so
                glad I did.
